            <h2>How to dry</h2>
            <p>There are many ways to dry a marajuana plant. The most typical way is to chop down either the whole plant or branches. Then hang it upside down in the dark. It is essentail to dry in the dark for the first 48 hours. There have been studies that show that exposing the plant to light after chopping it down reduces the amount of THC the plant has. After 4-5 days feel your cannabis. If cannabis feels dry or if any branches snap when you bend them, put the nugs in a jar with relative humidity reader. Look at the humidity reader every 6-12 hours for 36 hours. If the relative humidity in the jar ever exceeds 68% remove all the nug from the jar and dry if for longer. Having a drying rack to hang your nugs on is helpful to hang nugs after they have been cut off the plant. Wait over 24 hours before re-jarring the nugs and testing the huidity again. If 36 hours pass and the humidity in the jar remains under 68% congrats your weed is done drying. You can smoke it at this point but its going to be harsh. I reccomend you cure by following  the instructions below.</p>

            <h2>How to cure</h2>
            <p>Curing is pretty simple after your done drying. You just have to open your jars daily and let out excess humidity. To make it even easeir and better I recomend purchasing humidity control packets. Just fill your jar about 75% of the way full with nugs and place a humidity control packet in with the bud. I reccomend giving your bud at least two weeks to cure but ideally you will have 2 months to let it sit. Letting it sit for longer will make the weed smoother to smoke. I also reccomend that you open your jars every day for the first week to make sure you dont smell any fowl oder coming from the jar. Mold could be forming. The humidity packet helps prevent this. I reccomend getting anywhere from a 58% humidity packet to a 62% humidity packet. After waiting for your bud to cure it will be ready to smoke. Enjoy :)</p>
