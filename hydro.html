        <h2>Why Hydro?</h2>
        <p>Hyrdoponics create ideal conditions for your plants roots. You plants will be able to draw nutrients and water directly from their resivoir without any kind of buffer. When the plant has ideal PH, nutrints, mosture, light and space it thrives. Soil heavliy limits the root size one plant. You want the plant to have as much space as possible for the roots to grow. (Note: a plant will only get as big as its root mass allows). Hyrdoponics is known to increase the quality of the nugs while also decreasing the total time it takes to complete the grow.</p>
        <h2>Why doesnt everyone use hyrdo?</h2>
        <p>Hyrdroponics is a lot more involved then soil and it can only be done indoors. The easeist way to grow a lot of weed for cheap is to do it outside. The cost to power a light, a hydro sytem and fans can be pretty high. If your grow does not pan out, you could potentially loose hundreds of dollars in setup equipment and electrical cost. I would not reccomend hyrdro for a frist time grower. Many more factors affect a hydroponics grow then a soil grow. Everything from the ph of the water to the balence of the nutrients has to be just right or your expensive system with be wortheless.</p>

        <h2>DWC</h2>
        <p>DWC is one of the more common versions of hydroponics. Technically as long as you are growing your plant growing in water without soil its considered hydro. While there are many good versions of hydroponics, I am going to focus on DWC because it is what I am most familiar with. In essence Deep Water Culture (DWC) is just a plant inside a bucket of water; with a bubbler giving the roots fresh oxygen. The airation of the water helps preven the roots from develeping mold and makes it easeir for the plants to take in nutrients. I personally like this method becuase it doesnt require a whole lot of other materials other then buckets and a bubbler. Having a 5 gallon bucket with a 10 gallon bubbler provides more then enough space and airation for a massive plant. (see example below)</p>

                <h3>How to start your grow</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Set up your tent
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you tent is sturdy and can support at least 30 lbs.</li>
                        <li>Make sure your light is on a good light schedule (i normally like to do 6 hours light on 2 hours light off when my plant in in the veg stage)</li>
                        <li>Make sure you have your fans both bring air in and out of the tent but also blowing air around the tent</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fill a small pot with soil and drench it completly in water while mixing the soild around</li>
                <li>Placed germanted seed about a quarter to a half inch deep in the pot</li>
                <li>Place all pots with germinated seeds in your grow tent</li>
                <li>Let plants grow for 2-4 weeks</li>
                <li>After plants are a resonable size, remove the plant from the pots and rinse the roots until all soil is removed. (Note: soaking the plant in-between rinses is affective)</li>
                <li>Place plant with bare roots in the lids of your pots.</li>
                <li>Cover roots with leca</li>
                <li>Fill up bucket(s) with water and make it the correct PH</li>
                <li>Add nutrients solution to water</li>
                <li>Place lids in bucket</li>
                <li>Make sure lights schedual is set up and fans and bubblers are on.</li>

                <h3>Tips for your grow</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As long as you maintain water, nutrint and ph levels there nothing else to do. As long as out setup your DWC correclty you are going to spend most of your time waiting for the plants to do their thing.</li>
                    <li>Don't skip PH</li>
                    <li>Personally I aim for around 6.5 ph for the entire grow. Some people like to make it a little more acidic (up to 5.5) when the plant is in Veg.</li>
                    <li>Use reccomended amount of nutrients. (follow nutrient guide on bottom of article)</li>
                    <li>Switch the plants to 12 hours of light when your ready for flower</li>
                    <li>Empty and clean all buckets at least monthly (once every 2 weeks is reccomeneded)</li>
                    <li>Use techniques to increase yeild</li>
                    <li>Stop adding nutrients 2 weeks prior to flower</li>
                </ul>
