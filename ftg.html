            <h2>How to start your Grow</h2>
            <p>To start a grow you need weed seeds. After you have
                obtained your cannabis seeds, you need
                to germinate the seeds. Germination can be done many
                ways. I will share the method that has best worked for
                me. If you find yourself struggling with the method I 
                reccomend you look into other ways ther germinate your
                cannibis seeds.
            </p>
            <h3>How to germinate your weed seeds</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place your seeds in a cup of water for 12-24 hours.
                     ( I normally do around 24 hours)
                </li>
                <li>After the 24 hours dump some of the liquid and the
                    seeds into a paper towel. (add enough water so the
                     paper towel is saturated enough to be dripping)
                </li>
                <li>Check on the seeds every 12 hours or so. When you see a
                    white root emerge from the seed its ready to be planted. 
                </li>
